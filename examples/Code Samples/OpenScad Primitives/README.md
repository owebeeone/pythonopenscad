POSC Python to OpenScad Examples

This is intended as a resource for people who are proficient in openscad but are looking for transition to a 
Python based 'next step' in developmment. Although native OpenSCAD can scale to large projects, it is a painful process and difficult
to maintain. 

Python is a language that supports Object Oriented features such as classes and inheritence, in addition to a semi-infinite number of
 libraries. These capabilities enable developers to create signficantly more supportable models in OpenScad or develop application specific
frameworks. 

In any case, pythonopenscad provides a python API interface into the core functionality of OpenSCAD, and these sample scripts in this
directory demonstrate the mapping into OpenSCAD at the unit test level.
